# Inheritance
* In C++, inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. 
* In such way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other class.
* In C++, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class. 
* The derived class is the specialized class for the base class.

## Advantage of C++ Inheritance
* <b>Code reusability:</b> Now you can reuse the members of your parent class. 
* So, there is no need to define the member again. So less code is required in the class.
