Classes have objects which have the same data type as defined in the class.

## Constructors in C++

<img alt="constructor" src="./OOPS/constructorImg.jpg" />

* Invoked as soon as the class objects are created. 
* It can be parameterized as well.

## Copy Constructors

<img alt="copy-constructor" src="./OOPS/CopyConstructorImg.jpg" />

* To copy the class objects we use the copy constructor. 
* Here a student object is passed, it initializes the values to the new object.

## Destructors in C++

<img alt="destructor" src="./OOPS/DestructorImg.jpg" />

* Invoked when the object goes out of scope or is explicitly destroyed by a call to delete.
